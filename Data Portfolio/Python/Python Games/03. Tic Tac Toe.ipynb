The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.\n\nThere is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.\n\n# Game Design\n\nThe first thing to do is create the board. It should involve 9 squares, which will be delimited by a character. Each square will correspond to a number from 1 to 9.\n\nThen we should create the mechanics for the two players, one using X and the other 0. At the start of the game, the code will decide randomly who goes first.\n\nPlayers will decide which square they want to fill in with their symbol in their respective turn.\n\nThe game stops when there is a winner or when when all the squares are filled out. If  is able to fill out 3 consecutive diagonal, horizontal or vertical line, then he is declared the winner.\n\nI'll also create a table in order to keep track of the numbers of wins, losses or draws.\n\n\n# Importing Libraries\n\nAs usual, the first thing to do is importing the necessary tools from different libraries that are available to Python. I would want a <code>randint</code> in order to determine who goes first. <code>clear_output</code> will also be of help because we will clear the game in order to display the latest version of the board, each time.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from random import randint\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-09T21:09:27.931537Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-09T21:09:27.931961Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-09T21:09:27.935804Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-09T21:09:27.931931Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-09T21:09:27.934927Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":40,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Designing the Board\n\nAs mentioned, there will be 9 squares each corresponding to a number from 1 to 9.
