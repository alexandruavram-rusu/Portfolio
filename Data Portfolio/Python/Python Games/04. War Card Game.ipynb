Then they each draw the first card and show them. The winner of the round is the person that has the highest card. He gets to take the other's card and put it and his/her card at the back of the deck.

\n\nIt is important to note that the logic of a project should be planned before, as class structures or functions should be created around the logic of the program, not the other way around. Sometimes, you might be working on the logic and class structure of a program on the same time, to make sure they fit one with another and you can adapt them, depending on your progress.\n\nFirst things first, we need to create two obejcts of the player class, which will represent two computer players that will play one against another. Then, a new deck will be created and shuffled, after which it is splitted.\n\n\nThen, will need to start a `while loop` which will check if the game is still playing, or if anyone has won.In this while loop, we will need to compare cards one with another and have them attached to the deck of cards which the winning player already has, at the bottom of the deck. \n\nThere is also the *war* part, when 2 cards are equal one with another. In this case, we will draw 5 cards. A `while lopp` will be employed here as well, because there might be an instance in which, after drawing 5 cards, you still get a card that is equal with another, so we start a new *war*.
