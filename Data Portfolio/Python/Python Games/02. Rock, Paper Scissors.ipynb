I don't think I need to explain it, but I will do so nonetheless. Two players (you can sometimes play in a group as well) face off picking either a rock, a paper, or a pair of scissors and making hand signs that represent their choice. If both pick the same, the game starts again. The winner is determined by the following:\n* Rock beats Scissors\n* Scissors beats Paper\n* Paper beats Rock\n\nIn this case, we will have a player face off a computer that will randomly pick one choice. The game will have no graphics, but only text. \n\n# Importing Libraries \n\nThe frist thing to do is help ourselves to using *shuffle* and *clear_output* since I want to be able to repeat the game if I wanted to.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from random import shuffle\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-21T14:39:35.514066Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-21T14:39:35.514562Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-21T14:39:35.532742Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-21T14:39:35.514472Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-21T14:39:35.531877Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Gameplay Mechanics\n\nThe mechanics will involve the human player choosing one of the options by inputing 1, 2 or 3.
